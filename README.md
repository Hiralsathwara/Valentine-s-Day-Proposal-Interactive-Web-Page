# **Valentine's Day Interactive Proposal 💖**  

## **Overview**  
This is a fun and interactive **Valentine’s Day proposal web page** that playfully asks: **"Will you be my Valentine?"**. It includes animations, dynamic video changes, a moving "No" button, and a confetti celebration when "Yes" is selected.  

## **Features**  
- 🎥 **Video-Based Reactions** – The page displays different cute videos based on user responses.  
- 🎭 **Dynamic Text Change** – The proposal text updates with each "No" click.  
- 🎈 **Confetti Celebration** – Clicking "Yes" triggers a confetti effect.  
- 🏃 **Moving "No" Button** – The "No" button moves randomly when clicked, making it harder to press.  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a smooth and modern look.  

## **How It Works**  
1. The page loads with an adorable **video** and the proposal question.  
2. The user can click either **"Yes"** or **"No"**.  
3. Clicking **"No"** changes the video and message while making the button harder to press.  
4. Clicking **"Yes"** plays the final **celebration video** and triggers confetti.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **HTML** – Page structure
